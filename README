4.To view/monitor the heart rate data in real-time, use the following command;
`tail -f heart_rate_log.txt`

5.To run the log archival script, use the following command;
`./archive_log.sh`

## Report on team attendance.

The team has met once, an online meeting was first held on 1, Oct, 2024 and all members except Delphin attended.
