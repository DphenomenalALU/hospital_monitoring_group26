# Hopsital Data Handling and Monitoring System

This project aims to create a  system that  records heart rate data, archive logs, and securely backs them up into a remote server for future access

## Setting up
### Prerequisites

- Ensure you have a Unix/Linux environment with Bash shell support
- Ensure ypou have SSH access to backup remote server
- Ensure you have the necessary permissions to create and modify files in the working directory

### Set up instructions

To set up the program locally, follow this steps;

1.Once you have succesfully navigated to your system terminal, enter the following command.
`git clone git@github.com:DphenomenalALU/hospital_monitoring_group26.git`

2.Navigate to the directory
`cd hospital_monitoring_group26`

3.Run the heart rate monitoring script by entering the following command in the terminal 
`./heart_rate_monitor.sh`
- This should prompt for the device name, and begin logging heartrate data every second into heart_rate_log.txt and display the process ID

4.To view/monitor the heart rate data in real-time, use the following command;
`tail -f heart_rate_log.txt`

5.To run the log archival script, use the following command;
`./archive_log.sh`
